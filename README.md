# ConFInR

## About
ConFInR is a Python tool used for functional annotation of nucleotide sequences from metagenomics experiments. Its predecessor YEET (Yet anothEr mEtagenomics Tool) performs the pre-processing steps needed to filter out reads. ConFInR continues with this output and executes it against DIAMOND, a high performance sequence aligner, to align proteins to them and in turn annotate the protein's functions to the nucleotide sequences in another web-tool.
